        <h5 className="questions">Do you have minimums?</h5>
        <p>Yes, drop off service is a $300 food minimum + Onsite Catering is a $750 food minimum</p>

        <h5 className="questions">What is the catering surcharge?</h5>

        <p>The Catering Surcharge covers the use of our equipment, liability insurance fees, permits and other administrative

        expenses such as packing for your event, clean up, site visits, and detailed coordination with all parties (client,

          hospitality companies, wedding coordinators, etc.) leading up to the event. Please note that the Catering Surcharge

          is taxable and is not a gratuity for the staff.</p>

          <h5 className="questions">What other expenses can I expect?</h5>

          <p>We would love to put together a custom proposal for you. In the meantime, here are some average prices:</p>

          <p>Fresh staff - $14 per person</p>

          <p>Linen rentals - $4-6 per person</p>

          <p>Fresh Standard Tableware package (wine glass, water goblet, dinner plate, dessert plate, silverware) $5 per person</p>

          <h5 className="questions">How do I set up a tasting?</h5>

          <p>Tastings are included in some of our packages. Once youâ€™ve received a custom proposal that you are happy with, we

          will schedule a tasting if applicable.</p>

          <h5 className="questions">How can I reserve my event date?</h5>

          <p>We require a catering contract signed with a 25% deposit to secure the date of your event in our books. We prefer a

          check, but credit cards are accepted.</p>

          <h5 className="questions">When do I need to give you my Final Guest Count?</h5>

          <p>We require final guest counts 10 days prior to your event. After that, we cannot decrease your guest count. Change

          requests cannot be guaranteed after the 10 day mark. If you request to book an event within the 10 day period, the

          guest count listed on your contract is considered the FINAL guest count.</p>

          <h5 className="questions">When is Final Payment Due?</h5>

          <p>The payment schedule is as follows: 1 month prior to your event, 75% of your current balance is due. The remaining

          25% is due the week of your event.</p>
